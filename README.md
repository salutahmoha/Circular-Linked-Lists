# Circular Linked List (CLL)

## What is a Circular Linked List?

A **Circular Linked List** is a type of linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular chain. It can either be:
- **Singly Circular Linked List**: Each node has a single pointer pointing to the next node.
- **Doubly Circular Linked List**: Each node has two pointers: one pointing to the next node and the other to the previous node.
